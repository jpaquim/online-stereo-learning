# Online Stereo Learning

C++ code portion of my MSc thesis in self-supervised learning of depth from monocular images, given stereo data as the supervisory ground truth input.

The code is designed to work with both a generic stereo camera, as well as making use of the Stereolabs ZED SDK, if it is present.
